# gba-mmz-sprite-recolor-guide
PLEASE READ:
This is still very much in development. Right now you can just do the basics of inputting a color, previewing it, and outputting codebreaker codes for Zero and Action Replay codes for ZX.

Coming soon:  
-More sprites  
-Gallery  
-automatically generate colors for variations of a main color (eg. shades of color on forelimbs or shades of dash)  
-Ability to input an entire block of codes at once
