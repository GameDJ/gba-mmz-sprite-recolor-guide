# gba-mmz-sprite-recolor-guide
PLEASE READ:
This is still VERY MUCH in development, there are a lot of incomplete things. Right now you can just do the basics of inputting a color, previewing it, and outputting codebreaker codes.

Coming soon:  
-decimal RGB (0-255, 0-255, 0-255) able to be converted into GBA  
-Ability to input an entire block of codes at once  
-RGB sliders for selected color  
-Inputted colors adjust to nearest GBA-supported color  
-Different sprites (weapons, dash)  
-options to convert color codes in input boxes between hex, rgb, and gba  
-option for color swatches to show original color, inputted color, or both  
-automatically generate colors for variations of a main color (eg. shades of color on forelimbs)
