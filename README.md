# gba-mmz-sprite-recolor-guide
PLEASE READ:
This is still VERY MUCH in development, there are a lot of incomplete things. Right now all you can do is input 6 digit RGB hex codes (must include the # at the start) and output them to GBA codes.

Coming soon:  
-Previous codes disappear when output button is pressed again & color controls disappear when sprite selected again  
-Support for entering decimal RGB (0-255, 0-255, 0-255) and hex GBA (0000-7FFF)  
-Ability to input an entire block of codes at once  
-Click a pixel to highlight its color control (right now it just outlines all equivalent pixels and cant be unoutlined)  
-RGB sliders for selected color  
-Inputted colors adjust to nearest GBA-supported color on the display
-Different sprites (weapons mainly)
